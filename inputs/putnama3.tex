Alice and Bob play a game with a string of $n$ digits, each of which is
restricted to be $0$, $1$, or $2$. Initially all the digits are $0$.
A legal move is to add or subtract $1$ from one digit to create a new string
that has not appeared before. A player with no legal move loses, and the
other player wins. Alice goes first, and the players alternate moves.
For each $n \ge 1$, determine which player has a strategy that guarantees
winning.
