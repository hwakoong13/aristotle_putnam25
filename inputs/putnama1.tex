Let $m_0$ and $n_0$ be distinct positive integers. For every positive integer $k$, 
define $m_k$ and $n_k$ to be the relatively prime positive integers such that
\[
\frac{m_k}{n_k}=\frac{2m_{k-1}+1}{2n_{k-1}+1}.
\]
Prove that $2m_k+1$ and $2n_k+1$ are relatively prime for all but finitely 
many positive integers $k$.
