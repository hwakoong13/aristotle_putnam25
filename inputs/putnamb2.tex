Let $f:[0,1] \to [0,\infty)$ be strictly increasing and continuous. Let $R$ be the region bounded by $x = 0$, $x = 1$, $y = 0$, and $y = f(x)$. Let $x_1$ be the $x$-coordinate of the centroid of $R$. Let $x_2$ be the $x$-coordinate of the centroid of the solid generated by rotating $R$ about the $x$-axis. Prove that $x_1 < x_2$.
